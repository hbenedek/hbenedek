### Hi!

My name is Ben, I am a Research Intern at IBM Research in Zurich, currently working on my master's thesis in optimal transport for perturbation modeling. I am interested in statistics, algorithms, time series and reinforcement learning. I do most of my work in Python. In my free time, I enjoy playing chess, reading books, and skiing.
